# Simple todo-list app in React

School assignment in JavaScript/React, spring term 2021.

I unfortunately did not have much time to experiment with React as we were quickly moving on to ASP.NET, but a preview of the project is available at https://vjohannesb.github.io/js-uppgift-2. As of now the app is very bare, might come back and expand on this later.
