# JavaScript Assignment 2 - ReactJS To-Do App

School assignment in JavaScript/React, spring term 2021.

I unfortunately did not have much time to experiment with React as we were quickly moving on to ASP&#46;NET, but a preview of the project is available at https://vjohannesb.github.io/js-uppgift-2. As of now the app is very bare, but utilizes basic functionality of ReactJS such as hooks and state management.

### **G**:

-   Form to register and save task
-   List tasks

### **VG**:

-   Change status of task to incomplete/complete
-   Remove task from list
