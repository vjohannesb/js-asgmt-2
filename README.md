# Simple todo-list app in React

School assignment in JavaScript/React, january 2021.

Unfortunately I did not have much time to experiment with React as we were quickly moving on to ASP.NET, but a preview of the project is available at https://vjohannesb.github.io/js-uppgift-2. 
As of now the app is kind of bare; I would love to experiment more with creating different groups of todo-items, color pickers, implementing local storage, deletion animations as well as [@atlassians](https://github.com/atlassian) [drag-and-drop](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

Might come back later and expand this for fun.
